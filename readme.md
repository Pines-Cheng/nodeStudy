this is a Nodejs express study project,just for test.
I will add some modules by degresss to study them.


#feature

- use mysql

#add log
##12.21
 add sequelize
 
 ```
 npm install sequelize sequelize-cli
 ```
 
 if you use Express fragment,you can init project below.
 
 ```
 sequlize-cli init
 ```
 
use mysql in this project. 
note:
```
npm install mysql
```
is nedded,even if you have installed mysql,because this just like a sql driver.
